## Send {#send}

Previously, we saw that the recipe [bound](#bound) can be used to get a bound method from an instance. Unfortunately, invoking such methods is a little messy:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
mapWith(bound('eggs'))(inventories).map(
  function (boundmethod) {
    return boundmethod()
  }
)
  //=> [ 36, 12, 42 ]
~~~~~~~~

As we noted, it's ugly to write

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
function (boundmethod) {
  return boundmethod()
}
~~~~~~~~

So instead, we write a new recipe:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
var send = variadic( function (args) {
  var fn = bound.apply(this, args);

  return function (instance) {
    return fn(instance)();
  }
})

mapWith(send('apples'))(inventories)
  //=> [ 0, 240, 24 ]
~~~~~~~~

`send('apples')` works very much like `&:apples` in the Ruby programming language. You may ask, why retain `bound`? Well, sometimes we want the function but don't want to evaluate it immediately, such as when creating callbacks. `bound` does that well.

Here's a robust version that doesn't rely on `bound`:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
var send = variadic( function (methodName, leftArguments) {
  return variadic( function (receiver, rightArguments) {
    return receiver[methodName].apply(receiver, leftArguments.concat(rightArguments))
  })
});
~~~~~~~~
