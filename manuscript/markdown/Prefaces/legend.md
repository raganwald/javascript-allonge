## Legend

Some text in monospaced type like `this` in the text represents some code being discussed. Some monospaced code in its own lines also represents code being discussed:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
this.async = do (async = undefined) ->

  async = (fn) ->
    (argv..., callback) ->
      callback(fn.apply(this, argv))
~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it will contain some code for you to type in for yourself. When it does, the result of typing something in will often be shown using `//=>`, like this:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
2 + 2
  //=> 4
~~~~~~~~

T> A paragraph marked like this is a "key fact." It summarizes an idea without adding anything new.

X> A paragraph marked like this is a suggested exercise to be performed on your own.

A> A paragraph marked like this is an aside. It can be safely ignored. It contains whimsey and other doupleplusunserious logorrhea that will *not* be on the test.
