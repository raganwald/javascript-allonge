## Legend

Some text in monospaced type like `this` in the text represents some code being discussed. Some monospaced code in its own lines also represents code being discussed:

    this.async = do (async = undefined) ->

      async = (fn) ->
        (argv..., callback) ->
          callback(fn.apply(this, argv))
          
Sometimes it will contain some code for you to type in for yourself. When it does, the result of typing something in will often be shown using `//=>`, like this:

    2 + 2
      //=> 4

T> A paragraph marked like this is a "key fact." It summarizes an idea without adding anything new.

X> A paragraph marked like this is a suggested exercise to be performed on your own.

A> A paragraph marked like this is an aside. It can be safely ignored. It contains whimsey and other doupleplusunserious logorrhea that will *not* be on the test.
