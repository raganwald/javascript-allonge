Welcome!!!

Dear friends and readers:

On October 1st, 2013, I announced that [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) became free: It is now licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License][license]. You are free:

* to Share—to copy, distribute and transmit the work
* to Remix—to adapt the work
* to make commercial use of the work

Read the [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US) yourself for the full details. But the bottom line is, it’s free, *free*, **FREE**!

And don’t just take my word for it, [here’s the entire book online](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read).

### q & a

> I don't want to pay to download a PDF. Can I make my own?

Yes, you can take the HTML that is available online or the markdown source in this repository and make your own PDF. Or any other format.

> I'd like to share it

And I'd also like you to share it, in this form, in PDF, or anything else. Go wild, just follow the attribution rules in the [license].

> Hey, I have a great way to make money with this.

Go for it, you are free to make commercial use of the work. For example, you could:

* Take this book, add your own annotations, expansions, and commentary, and sell it yourself.
* Sell it in ebook form for less than I'm charging.
* Host it on your site and make money from ads.
* Write a JS tool and use the book as part of the help content.

It's all good, just follow the [license terms][license].

> I found a typo! Can I email you about it?

Thanks, but my email inbox is a disaster zone. Let's treat the book like OSS. In order of my preference, you should:

1. Create an [issue], fork the repo, fix the issue, and then send me a [pull request][pull]. (Best!!)
2. Fork the repo, fix things to your satisfaction, and then send me a [pull request][pull]. (Better!)
3. Create an [issue]. (Good.)

Thanks!
